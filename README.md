## 🤖 How the Chatbot Works

The Gita Chatbot uses an intelligent semantic search algorithm to find relevant verses:

### 1. Keyword Expansion

The chatbot expands your query using a predefined keyword mapping:

- **Stress** → anxiety, worry, fear, trouble, difficulty, sorrow, grief
- **Duty** → dharma, responsibility, obligation, work, action, karma
- **Happiness** → joy, peace, bliss, contentment, satisfaction
- And many more...

### 2. Relevance Scoring

Each verse is scored based on:

- **Exact phrase matches** (highest priority)
- **Expanded keyword matches**
- **Original word matches**
- **Field-specific matches** (meaning, Hindi meaning, chapter summary)

### 3. Results Ranking

Verses are sorted by relevance score and the top 5 most relevant verses are returned.

### 4. Response Generation

The chatbot formats the response with:

- Chapter number and name
- Verse number and meaning
- Clickable links to read the full verse

**Note**: The chatbot works completely offline - no external APIs or internet connection required!

## 🌟 About the Sacred Texts

### Bhagavad Gita

The Bhagavad Gita is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is part of the epic Mahabharata. It presents a conversation between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna, who serves as his charioteer and spiritual guide. The text addresses the moral and philosophical dilemmas faced by Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

### Hanuman Chalisa

Hanuman Chalisa is a Hindu devotional hymn (stotra) addressed to Lord Hanuman. It was authored by Tulsidas in the Awadhi language and is his best-known text. The word "chalisa" is derived from "chalis", which means the number forty in Hindi, as the Hanuman Chalisa has 40 verses.

### Sunderkand

Sunderkand is the fifth book of the Ramayana. It describes the journey of Hanuman to Lanka in search of Sita. The name "Sunderkand" means "beautiful chapter" and it is considered one of the most important parts of the Ramayana.

### Bajrang Baan

Bajrang Baan is a powerful prayer dedicated to Lord Hanuman. It is believed to be composed by Tulsidas and is known for its protective and powerful verses. The name "Bajrang" refers to Lord Hanuman, and "Baan" means arrow.

### Yaksha Prashna

Yaksha Prashna is a dialogue between Yudhishthira and a Yaksha (a nature spirit) in the Mahabharata. It consists of 126 questions and answers that test Yudhishthira's wisdom and righteousness. The questions cover various aspects of life, duty, and philosophy.
